# webpack react redux Notebook Example

## Purpose

Now I'm using it to learn about [Webpack]

## Thanks

This codebase was originally taken from the TodoMVC project starting [here](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/563d1e1b8cee5f6ec962ec43663cb66a72b69d76/examples/vanillajs). Big thanks to them!

## Project Setup

This project assumes you have [NodeJS v6](http://nodejs.org/) or greater installed. You should
also have [npm v3](https://www.npmjs.com/) or greater installed as well (this comes packaged
with Node 6). You'll also need a recent version of [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
as well.

At the start hit 'npm i'. Run project via 'npm start'. Build - 'npm run build'

You may have come to this project from different varying sources. There are a
different series of branches for each workshop/course I've done. To get started with
the project, start with this:
